# Some Initial Planning for the Investulator App

Investulator:

Important Points to do in the next year:
Minimum Amount to use : 2,00,000 /-

1. Find out ways or formulas that we need to implement, test them and check if they are all valid and can be used by the user/customers
2. Find out way to patent this idea after we get all the formulas
3. Find out 2-3 ways to monetise it. It can be premium plans or subscription plans, or advertisement plans
4. Find out the cost for building the MVP and to deploy the same over any platform
5. Find out ways to actually market the same over advertise and get the data to analyse 
6. Find out ways to but the domain investulator.com , investulator.in or anything that clicks.

This will be a web app, which will give you a solution to investing in various options as per your income and requirement.

It will also suggest the best and default plan for the customer. You can edit the same by incrementing or decrementing the percentage of salary / income you earn every month. The app is not limited to the salaried individuals but also the business individuals.

Right now there are lot of the finance influencers that give advices and information on investing in various platform. But when a person actually starts doing it, they lack the exact amount they want to invest, the percentage of the salary they want to invest. Etc

The app makes it easier for the user, it uses the ratio wrt to the salary/total amount you want to use for a month. For example if the person is earning 10000/- , the default saving from the same would be 30% ideally. So he could save 3000, he will get the amount 3000 as a value for his input for 10000 amount he wants to invest, save and use for personal use.

There are fields or certain values that he may add or remove as well. For ex: There can be a field like RD, and he wants to divide the total savings into 2 part, 1 saving and 2nd one as RD, so it gets 15% and saving gets 15% as well. There are options to edit the fields as well. We will just give them the choice as default. But will keep standard of 30% saving 50% of investing and 20% of wants or needs. Keeping investing 50% as that is the goal of the app, to make the person start investing with any amount he wants to use starting from 5000 - 5,00,000 any amount.
